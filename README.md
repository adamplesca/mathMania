# Math Mania: My Game Evolution Journey

### The Old Version: True or False

When I first developed the **"True or False"** game, it was a straightforward quiz with static questions and a basic scoring system. Players answered true or false to fixed questions. It was simple, but it lacked variety and excitement. Here’s a glimpse of that old version:

### The New Version: Math Mania

With **"Math Mania,"** I aimed to spice things up. This new version introduces randomization with various arithmetic operations—**addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division**. I also added a **timer** and a **lives system** to make the game more challenging and engaging. It’s a significant leap from the old version. Here’s a look at the updated game:

## Key Improvements

- **Dynamic Questions:** Unlike the fixed and unrandomized questions of the old version, "Math Mania" features **random math problems**.
 This allows for **infinite playability** and keeps the experience fresh each time.
- **Timed Challenges:** There’s now a **countdown timer** to keep you on your toes and make each second count.
- **Lives System:** Incorrect answers or running out of time will **cost you lives**, increasing the game’s difficulty and urgency.
- **Enhanced UI:** A **modern, responsive design** makes the game more visually appealing and user-friendly.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game:** Hit **"Start Game"** to kick things off.
2. **Answer Questions:** Decide if the presented math equation is **correct or false** within the time limit.
3. **Score and Lives:** Correct answers earn points, but wrong answers or running out of time will **cost you lives**.

When you run out of lives, the game wraps up with your final score.
