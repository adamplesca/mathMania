Revisiting a coding project I done terribly in the past that's up on my github currently. Even back then I really wanted to make this mini game but just didn't have the knowledge and understanding to do it properly. I have some better ideas now which I'd like to put to the test.

Old project repo link (although will include images and explanations of old VS new project)
